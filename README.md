# Social Media Auto-Posting Application

Welcome to the **Social Media Auto-Posting Application** challenge! In this coding challenge, your mission is to create a web-based application that simulates automatic posting of content to a social media account based on a predefined schedule. While you won't be integrating with an actual social media platform, you will develop a captivating homepage that showcases the scheduled posts.

## Challenge Description

Your task is to design and build a web application that allows users to schedule and display posts on a virtual homepage. The application should follow the specified requirements outlined below:

## Requirements

1. **User Interface**:
   - Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the application's homepage.
   - Display a list of scheduled posts with details such as content and scheduled time.
   - Include a user-friendly form for creating new posts, providing fields for content and scheduled time.

2. **Scheduled Posting**:
   - Implement a mechanism to schedule posts to be displayed at specific times.
   - Posts should automatically appear on the homepage at their scheduled times.
   - Users should have the ability to edit or delete their scheduled posts.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Utilize a suitable database or storage solution to save and retrieve scheduled posts.
   - Ensure that the application retrieves and displays posts from the database accurately.

4. **Timezone Handling**:
   - Handle timezones effectively to ensure that posts are displayed accurately across different time zones.

5. **Validation and Error Handling**:
   - Implement validation checks for input fields when creating new posts.
   - Provide clear and meaningful error messages to users in case of invalid inputs or scheduling errors.

6. **Optional Features** (Bonus):
   - Enhance the user experience by allowing users to upload images or videos for their posts.
   - Strengthen security by implementing user authentication and authorization for posting functionality.
   - Introduce a search/filter option to help users easily locate and manage their scheduled posts.
   - Add a touch of real-time magic by using WebSockets to reflect post changes on the homepage without needing a page refresh.

## Submission Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when submitting your solution:

- Provide the source code for your application.
- Include detailed instructions on setting up and running the application locally (if applicable).
- Optionally, provide a concise overview or documentation that explains the application's architecture, design decisions, and any challenges you encountered during development.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality**: Does the application accurately simulate scheduled posts and enable users to create, view, edit, and delete posts?
- **User Interface**: Is the user interface well-designed, user-friendly, and responsive?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, organized, and adequately commented? Does it adhere to best coding practices?
- **Timezone Handling**: Does the application handle timezones correctly to ensure accurate scheduling and display?
- **Optional Features** (Bonus): Implementation of optional features will contribute to a higher evaluation score.

Feel free to add any extra features or enhancements that showcase your creativity and coding skills. We encourage you to have fun, explore, and create a truly engaging and magical experience for users.

Happy coding, and let the magic of Social Media Auto-Posting begin!
